# safe_compare
This is a C++14 library for safe C++ integer comparisons.

# Motivation
The following C++ program is not mathematically correct.
```
bool doit() {
    if(1U<-1) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```
Due to integer promotion rules, the -1 is converted to unsigned which (usually) means it will be a large positive number and therefore larger than 1U. This will normally give you a compiler warning so you detect it:
```
warning: comparison of integer expressions of different signedness: 'unsigned int' and 'int' [-Wsign-compare]
```
You would manually need to fix this problem which is a bit tedious. This library is here to help you with that.
```
#include "safe_compare/safe_compare.hpp"
bool doit() {
    if(safe_compare::make_safe(1U)<safe_compare::make_safe(-1)) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```
This is now mathematically correct. The example may look contrived, but happens quite often. A realistic example is when using int for lengths, then comparing against .size() from an STL container, like std::vector. Those use size_t, which is unsigned.

# Building and using the library
This is a header only library. The library uses CMake. Here is how to build the unit tests on Linux.
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
You can also install the library, using the conventional cmake mechanism to specify the install dir. For a default system wide install, ```make install``` should do the trick.

#License
The library uses several licenses. The relevant part of the library (what you would use in other projects) uses dual licensing. Pick the one you prefer:

  * Boost 1.0
  * GPLv2 (or later, at your option)

Regarding support files, some of them are based on code from other projects.

  * CMakeLists.txt are partially based on the strong types library (by Jonathan MÃ¼ller), which is MIT licensed.
  * Some support files used for the unit test are based on code from Stack Overflow, so they use CC BY-SA 3.0.

Each individual file is clearly marked at the top which license it uses.
